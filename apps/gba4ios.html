          GBA4iOS is a Game Boy Advance emulator created by iOS developer Riley Testut.
          <div class="desc" style="display:none">
          Built and designed from the ground up for iOS 7, GBA4iOS takes advantage of many tools provided in the iOS SDK to take emulation to the next level. Simplicity and speed are big factors, but it is also powerful, being able to emulate not just GBA, but GBC and GB games. 2.0 also includes numerous, highly-requested features such as Cheats, iPad optimization, AirPlay, Dropbox sync and more. 			  	  	          	
				<br><br>
		After the first version of GBA4iOS took off and was downloaded worldwide, what imminently followed was Apple getting involved and shutting down the distribution method altogether, forcing people to rely on a popular "date trick" loophole. Riley didn't see this as defeat and pursued a comeback in the form of version 2.0, which was worked on for the better part of a year. A closed beta testing was held in September 2013 that lasted almost 6 months with as many as 40 people helping to make sure the app was stable enough for release.
				<br><br>
		On February 19, 2014, GBA4iOS 2.0 was finally released to much anticipation. It has been downloaded over 10 million times and remains one of the most popular and easily downloadable emulators available today.
