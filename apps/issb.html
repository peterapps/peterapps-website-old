          iSSB is a mobile version of the popular Super Smash Bros. Brawl!
          <div class="desc" style="display:none">
          This application was developed by Luis Finke (aka <a class="link-colors" href="http://twitter.com/lufinkey">@lufinkey</a>), a programmer and student with the focus of creating a game based on a highly popular series that you would want to play. Several versions of iSSB can be played on numerous devices such as Windows, Mac, Linux and Online. The iOS version can be found on both Jailbreak and non-Jailbreak devices.<br><br>

iSSB supports all version of iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch running iOS 5 and above. However it is only optimized for a 4‚Äù display so it will be in letterbox on iPads and have black sidebars on iPhones. The developer has stated that he plans on optimizing it for most iOS devices in future updates. <br><br>

This application should be considered still in beta as it is far from being finished and is in need of some refinement. The developer will continue to improve it as long as users still enjoy the application and whenever his time as a student allow it! <br><br>

iEmulators is one of the very rare sites where we work closely with the developer to improve and update to newer versions. We ask that if you find any issue or feedback, just email it to us.
