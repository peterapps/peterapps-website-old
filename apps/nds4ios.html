          nds4ios, a Nintendo DS emulator, is a port of the multi-platform <em>DeSmuME 0.9.10</em> for iOS.
          <div class="desc" style="display:none">
          It runs many of the original games but, depending on the power of your device, not all may run at full speed. nds4ios was created by InfiniDev, a joint development group with many members including popular GBA4iOS creator Riley Testut (<a class="link-colors" href="http://twitter.com/rileytestut">@rileytestut</a>), upcoming Nightingale app developer Michael Zhang (<a class="link-colors" href="http://twitter.com/malvix_">@malvix_</a>) and PPSSPP iOS build manager Karen Tsai (<a class="link-colors" href="http://twitter.com/angelxwind">@angelxwind</a>), along with many others. However, as of August 2014, the team has since disbanded and nds4ios is no longer being updated or worked on.<br><br>
    
nds4ios supports all versions of iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch running iOS 5 and above; except  iPod touch 4, iPad 1, iPhone 3GS, and anything below those devices. This is because nds4ios’s emulation is powered by a threaded ARM interpreter. As a result, emulation is rather slow on older devices, like the iPhone 4s and below. nds4ios runs at nearly full speed on the iPhone 5 and above, and achieves full speed on devices using the A7-S5L8960X SoC (iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini Retina, and anything newer than these devices).<br><br>

The emulator does not require bios to play but requires ROM images and no ROMs are provided - it is up to you to procure them. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing or the “Open in” feature. The "+" button feature is no longer included in this version due to legal issues with Nintendo in the past. <br><br>


On August of 2014, nds4ios was engaged in some legal issues with Nintendo that has since ruined all hope of continuing with future updates. Many weeks after the source and download links were taken down and the app could not be downloaded officially anywhere, iEmulators has been granted special permission by one of their developers to continue distributing the app. Please know that this will be the last version updated (possibly forever) and that neither nds4ios developers or iEmulators can help you with support issues pertaining to updating the app or fixing potential bugs.
